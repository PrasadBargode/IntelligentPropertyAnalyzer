# Intelligent_Property_Analyser
The objective of this project is to develop a ML-poweered automated system using python centric libraries to accomplish the following:

a) To predict the approximate price of a housing property based on multiplt factors related to the property.

b) Design a web UI for user to access the system and feed data related to the property for analysis.

c) Design an end-to-end ML-based system that would be trained with sufficient datasets to accomplish the task with acceptable accuracy.
